## Overview

Lab4PurpleSec is an evolving cybersecurity homelab designed for Red Team and Blue Team training in a near-enterprise environment, integrating network/web pentesting, Active Directory, detection, SIEM, and IDS/IPS.

Project intended for students and cybersecurity enthusiasts!

## Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements

**Lab4PurpleSec** is designed to be flexible and can be deployed according to your needs and available resources. You don't need to run all VMs simultaneously - scenarios are designed to be executed step-by-step.

#### Minimum Configuration (Limited Scenarios)

- **RAM:** 16 GB minimum
- **CPU:** 4-core processor (i5/i7 or equivalent)
- **Storage:** 150 GB free disk space
- **Use Case:** Run 2-3 VMs at a time for specific scenarios (e.g., web server + attack machine, or SIEM + one target)

#### Recommended Configuration (Full Lab Experience)

- **RAM:** 32 GB recommended
- **CPU:** 6+ core processor (i5/i7/i9 or equivalent)
- **Storage:** 200+ GB free disk space (SSD recommended)
- **Use Case:** Run multiple VMs simultaneously for complex scenarios (e.g., full AD environment + SIEM + web services)

#### Optimal Configuration (Maximum Performance)

- **RAM:** 64 GB
- **CPU:** 8+ core processor (i9/Ryzen 9 or equivalent)
- **Storage:** 500+ GB free disk space (NVMe SSD recommended)
- **Use Case:** Run entire lab simultaneously with all services active

> **Note**: These prerequisites are for a reference configuration. You can customize them to fit your needs. Of course, the RAM is **the most important resource** to consider (for virtualisation, CPU/GPU power is not as important as RAM).

**Important Notes:**

- **You can customize VM resources** in the `Vagrantfile` to match your hardware (reduce RAM/CPU per VM if needed)
- **Not all VMs need to run at once** - start only the VMs needed for your current scenario
- **Wazuh Manager (LAN-SIEM-LIN) requires 8GB RAM** - this is the most resource-intensive VM
- **GOAD VMs (Windows)** require significant resources - consider running them separately if RAM is limited
- **Disk space usage:** With default settings, the lab uses approximately 130-150 GB

For detailed hardware and software requirements, see `docs/SETUP/prereqs.md`.

### Software Requirements

- **Hypervisor:** VirtualBox or VMware Workstation/Player
- **Vagrant:** Version 2.2+ (for automated VMs)
- **Ansible:** Optional, for manual playbook execution
- **ISO Images:** See `docs/SETUP/prereqs.md` for complete list

### Project Goals

**Lab4PurpleSec** does not provide pre-built virtual machines (OVA/OVF). Installation is done entirely "from scratch" by following the detailed guides provided. This approach:

- **Encourages learning**: Understanding each installation and configuration step
- **Ensures reproducibility**: Each user builds their environment identically (yet still customizable)
- **Strengthens understanding**: Mastery of systems, networks, and configurations
- **Facilitates customization**: Easy adaptation according to specific needs

## TL;DR

**Lab4PurpleSec** includes the following features:

- Segmented architecture (WAN, DMZ, LAN, AD)
- pfSense firewall, Suricata IDS/IPS, Wazuh SIEM
- Vulnerable machines (OWASP, Metasploitable, Windows DC)
- Detailed installation and configuration guides

## Network Architecture

### Lab4PurpleSec

Lab4PurpleSec is an environment dedicated to application and system vulnerability exploitation, hosting intentionally vulnerable machines (Metasploitable2/3), OWASP web applications in an isolated DMZ zone, as well as a vulnerable Active Directory environment (GOAD MINILAB).

![Homelab-light.png](/assets/images/Diagrams/Homelab-light.png)

### GOAD-MINILAB

GOAD-MINILAB replicates a simplified Active Directory environment with a domain controller and a Windows client workstation (multiple if needed), allowing simulation of various types of Active Directory-oriented attacks.

## Quick Start

> **⚠️ Security Warning**: This lab contains intentionally vulnerable services. **Never** connect these machines to a production network. Always change default passwords after installation. This environment is designed for isolated, educational use only.

### Option 1: Automated Deployment (Recommended)

**Lab4PurpleSec** provides semi-automated deployment using Vagrant and Ansible for most internal VMs.

**Quick Start:**

On Windows:
```powershell
cd automation # Navigate to the automation directory
$env:VAGRANT_ANSIBLE = "true" # Enable Ansible provisioning
vagrant up # Start the VMs
```

On Linux/macOS:
```bash
cd automation # Navigate to the automation directory
export VAGRANT_ANSIBLE=true # Enable Ansible provisioning
vagrant up # Start the VMs
```

**What is automated:**

Deployment of the following VMs is automated:

- LAN-SIEM-LIN (Wazuh Manager)
- LAN-TEST-LIN (Ubuntu Desktop with GUI)
- LAN-ATTACK-LIN (Kali Linux)
- WAN-ATTACK-LIN (Kali Linux)
- DMZ-WEB01-LIN (Debian web server)

**What still requires manual setup:**

- pfSense firewall (manual ISO installation)
- GOAD MINILAB (external repository)
- Metasploitable2/3 (external repositories)
- Wazuh agents on Windows/pfSense
- Web server applications (Docker Compose)
- Network configurations (pfSense, Suricata, Wazuh, GOAD, etc.)

**See:**

- `automation/README.md` for detailed automation documentation
- `automation/ORCHESTRATION.md` for complete deployment orchestration
- `docs/SETUP/README.md` for detailed manual installation guides

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

For complete manual installation (educational purposes):

1. Prerequisites (See `docs/SETUP/prereqs.md`):
   - Hypervisor (VMware Workstation / VirtualBox / Hyper-V)
     > **Note**: This lab can be deployed using VirtualBox if needed, but VMware Workstation Pro was personally used for this documentation.
   - ISO images necessary for operating system installation
   - Internet connection to download dependencies and tools
2. Install VMs (excluding GOAD-MINILAB).
3. Create 3 networks / interfaces on the hypervisor (cf. `docs/SETUP/prereqs.md`):
   1. Example for pfSense VM (3 network cards):
      - Virtual WAN: Bridge/Bridged mode (DHCP)
      - LAN: LAN Segment on 192.168.10.0/24
      - DMZ: LAN Segment on 192.168.20.0/24
4. Deploy pfSense (cf. `docs/SETUP/pfsense_setup.md`):
   1. Configure the previous interfaces.
   2. Assign IP addresses on the interfaces.
   3. Access the pfSense web interface and verify the previous configurations.
   4. Add firewall rules.
   5. Configure the NAT rule for the Nginx reverse proxy.
5. Deploy Suricata on pfSense (cf. `docs/SETUP/pfsense_setup.md`).
6. Deploy Wazuh Manager (SIEM) then agents on targets (Linux/Windows). See `docs/SETUP/Wazuh_setup.md`.
7. Set up GOAD and Windows client machines, then integrate into the LAN. See `docs/SETUP/GOAD_setup.md`.
8. Run verification tests from `docs/TESTS/` to ensure everything is properly configured.

You can now enjoy **Lab4PurpleSec** as you wish!

You can:

- Add/Remove machines, tools, technologies freely.
- Modify the parameters of different lab machines according to your scenario.
- Use the lab as is.
- Perform various Purple Team scenarios (your creativity is the limit!).

> **Note**: The pfSense VM/router (FW-PFSENSE) must be started systematically for the lab to function properly.

**See:** `docs/SETUP/README.md` for detailed manual installation guides.

## Possible Scenarios

### 1. Pivoting — WAN → DMZ → LAN

**Objective:** Obtain initial access on a web VM in DMZ then pivot to a LAN/AD machine.

**Skills / tools:** Reconnaissance, Tunneling (SSH/SOCKS, proxychains), pivoting.

**Expected results:** web logs + IDS alerts + Wazuh alerts.

**Point to consider:** Adapt pfSense rules (simulating a misconfiguration).

### 2. OWASP Web Exploit → Persistence (webshell)

**Objective:** Exploit a web vulnerability (upload, RCE or LFI) on a DMZ service and establish limited persistence.

**Skills / tools:** web app testing, BurpSuite, OWASP Top 10, webshell, command injection, file upload, HTTP.

**Expected results:** web logs + IDS alerts + webshell capture.

### 3. Kerberoasting (AD) — reconnaissance & ticket recovery

**Objective:** Recover Kerberos service tickets to attack service accounts.

**Skills / tools:** AD enumeration, Kerberos tickets, hash cracking.

**Expected results:** AD logs + IDS alerts + Wazuh logs showing abnormal activity, timeline.
